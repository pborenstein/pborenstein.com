The server has not found anything matching the `Request-URI`.
No indication is given of whether the condition
is temporary or permanent.

The `410` (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the
server knows, through some internally configurable mechanism,
that an old resource is permanently unavailable
and has no forwarding address.

This status code is commonly used when the
server does not wish to reveal exactly why
the request has been refused,
or when no other response is applicable.
