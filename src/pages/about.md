I gave this list
to GPT-3 and gave it the prompt
"Write this as a Wall Street Journal feature".

<div markdown=1>
<pre style="font-family: var(--font-body);
font-style: italic; line-height: 1.2">

</pre>

This is what it came up with. Most of it
is wrong. I'm much older than 25. The Boy is what I call my son. I never called myself a "neurodiversity enthusiast", but I like it. 

> As the Twitter meltdown and the rise of the Fediverse put a spotlight on the need for more diverse online spaces, one individual is taking a unique approach to the problem. The Boy, as he prefers to be called, is a 25-year-old software developer and self-proclaimed “neurodiversity enthusiast” who has been quietly creating content for years. 

> From blogs to notebooks, The Boy has amassed a wealth of content that he is now looking to share with the world. But instead of relying on mainstream platforms like Twitter or Facebook, he’s turning to the IndieWeb, a decentralized network of sites and tools that allow users to own and control their own content. 

> The Boy is hopeful that his content can help create an online space that is more inclusive and accommodating for those who identify as neurodiverse—a term that refers to a wide range of neurological conditions, including autism, ADHD, and dyslexia. He believes that by using the IndieWeb, he can create a platform that allows neurodiverse individuals to express themselves without fear of judgement or censorship. 

> The Boy’s story is a testament to the power of the IndieWeb and its potential to create a more equitable online ecosystem. As he continues to share his content, it’s clear that his unique approach could be a beacon of hope for those who have long been excluded from the online conversation.

It all sounds a lot like work. I would never spell judgment like that.
