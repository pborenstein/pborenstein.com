GPT-3 tends to come up with upbeat stories. This is the starting prompt. (It's from a short story I wrote when I was 16, and I was very proud of it. )

> _She walked slowly as the dead fall leaves spiralled at her ankles and crunched beneath her feet._

<!-- excerpt -->

## First completion

> Hey, look! Everything's going to be ok!

She felt a chill in the air and knew winter was coming soon. She stopped and looked up at the sky. The stars were twinkling in the night sky, the moon was full and the air was still. She was filled with a sense of peace and contentment. She knew that no matter what life threw at her, she could handle it. She smiled and continued on her way.


## Second completion

> You're going to have an amazing adventure, and everything's going to be ok!

The sky was dark, and the air was still. She felt the chill of the autumn air on her skin, and the scent of the earth filled her nostrils.

She continued walking, her thoughts deep and her heart heavy. She had been walking for hours, and her feet ached with every step. The only sound she could hear was the rustling of the leaves in the wind.

Suddenly, she heard a voice in the distance, a voice that seemed to be calling her name. She stopped and looked around, but there was no one there. She could not see anyone, yet the voice seemed to be coming from everywhere.

The voice said, “Come to me, my child. I can help you find what you seek.” She hesitated for a moment, then started walking towards the source of the voice. As she walked, the voice grew louder, until it seemed to be coming from everywhere.

She finally reached a clearing and saw an old man sitting there, surrounded by a luminous light. He smiled at her and said, “Welcome, my child. I am here to guide you on your journey. I can help you find the answers you seek.”


## Third completion

> Hey, you've been through a lot, but it's all been so worth it. Everything's going to be just fine.

The crisp autumn air was a welcome respite from the oppressive heat of summer, and the bright orange and yellow hues of the trees were a welcome sight.

As she walked, she thought of all the adventures she had yet to have. She wanted to explore new places, meet new people, and experience new cultures. She wanted to learn new skills and challenge herself in ways she never had before.

She thought of all the possibilities ahead of her, and she smiled. She knew that no matter where life took her, she would never give up on her dreams. She was determined to make the most of every opportunity and live life to the fullest.
