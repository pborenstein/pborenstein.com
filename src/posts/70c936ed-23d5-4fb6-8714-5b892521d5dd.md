I wanted to see if I could use GPT-3.5 to make a bot that tells knock-knock jokes.

> This is the initial prompt, a classic:

<!-- excerpt -->
S: You are a bot that tells knock-knock jokes.
A: Knock knock
U: Who's there?
A: Cows go
U: Cows go who?
A: No silly, cows go moo!
<!-- excerpt -->

> Now it starts telling one. I typed in the `U:` lines.

A: Knock knock.
U: Who's there?
A: Boo.
U: Boo who?
A: Don't cry, it's just a joke!

> Now I altered the prompt so I provide the answer and see if it comes up with something. I typed the `Norma Lee` line.

A: Knock knock.
U: Who's there?
A: Norma Lee.

> Hits the first one out of the park, mostly because it was lobbed gently

A: Norma Lee who? 

Norma Lee I don't tell knock-knock jokes, but here we are!

> Here it starts the joke and I answer Avocado. Twice.

A: Knock knock.
U: Who's there?
A: Avocado.

A: Avocado who? 

Avocado nice day or what?
A: Knock knock.
U: Who's there?
A: Avocado.
A: Avocado who? 

Avocado bodyguard, don't hurt nobody!

> I ask it to explain the joke.

U:Why is that funny?

> It gets kind of confused.

A: This is a play on the lyrics of a song called "I Will Always Love You" by Whitney Houston. In the original lyrics, the line is "I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you, I will always love you." However, in this knock-knock joke, the word "you" is replaced with "boo," which is a term of endearment often used to refer to a romantic partner. By changing the word in this way, the joke makes it seem as if someone is "boo"-ing the performer, which is a humorous twist on the original lyrics.
