I've been [playing](https://pborenstein.dev/posts/c8a9b0e0-b4dc-4227-a612-a4df6f44baec/) with using the GPT API in Drafts actions.

I've been watching Battlestar Galactica from beginning to end. It doesn't matter why. Jimi Hendrix's _All Along the Watchtower,_ is a recurring motif. I know that because I kind of recognized the song, and instead of Googling it as is usual, I tried asking my latest GPT Chat toy. 

> `What is the song that leads Galactica to salvation`

> A: The song that leads Galactica to salvation is "All Along the Watchtower" by Jimi Hendrix.

That was pretty good. Of coursed I remembered the song now. But I had a follow-up question:

> `Why?`

> A: As an AI language model, I don't have beliefs, emotions, or preferences to explain why. However, in the TV series Battlestar Galactica, the song "All Along the Watchtower" is heard repeatedly throughout the final season, and it is revealed that the characters have been hearing it in their minds because it is the key to unlocking the coordinates to the mythical planet Earth. The song acts as a signal to the fleet to come together and find their new home, leading them to salvation.

So that's the thing about OpenAI's GPT: It gets a little prissy. You have to avoid words that (please forgive me) trigger its finer sensibilities. So I tried again.

> `U:What do the writers of the show say about that`

> A: The writers of the show have said that the choice of "All Along the Watchtower" was intentional, as it is a popular song with a timeless quality that still resonates with audiences today. They also wanted to create a sense of mystery and tension around the song, as it was heard by the characters but not immediately understood by them. The use of the song throughout the final season allowed the writers to tie together various storylines and character arcs in a powerful, emotional culmination. Overall, the choice of "All Along the Watchtower" was a deliberate and well-planned decision by the writers to enhance the themes and message of the show.
