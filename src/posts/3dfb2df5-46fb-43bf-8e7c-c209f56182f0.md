_Stevie Smith_

Nobody heard him, the dead man,
But still he lay moaning:
I was much further out than you thought
And not waving but drowning.
<!-- excerpt -->
Poor chap, he always loved larking
And now heâ€™s dead
It must have been too cold for him his heart gave way,
They said.
<!-- excerpt -->
Oh, no no no, it was too cold always
(Still the dead one lay moaning)
I was much too far out all my life
And not waving but drowning.
