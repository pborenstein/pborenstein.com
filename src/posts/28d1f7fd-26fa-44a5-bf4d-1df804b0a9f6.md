I can only keep track of three things at a time. Two really, but if I stretch my brain a tiny bit I can do three. 

Two single-digit numbers? cake
Two two-digit numbers: two columns and an extra register for the carries

the only way I can work with more than three things is to chunk them up into units made up of two pieces and a resister

when I'm in the zone on flow it feels like I'm spinning plates like I have a sprawling edifice supported by a thin pylon

the structure has to be built up slowly correctly adjusted carefully as it grows and it is concentration that holds everything t together

break the concentration and everything collapses
