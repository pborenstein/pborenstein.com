The fun part of blogging is messing around with the blogging platform. But once you've done that, you have to fill it with content.
<!-- excerpt -->

I had a few articles about Git and Markdown on this domain, but I also had the `pborenstein.dev` domain (because all the cool kids have a `.dev` domain), and I wanted to use it. So I moved all the technical stuff about Git, Markdown, and Eleventy, [over there](https://pborenstein.dev). An [article about collections](https://pborenstein.dev/posts/collections/) seems to be the most popular.


Now I need some content to fill this. I'm using some posts from an earlier incarnation of this site.

I've done thee Re-Launch Your Blog with a New Blogging Platforms project several times over the years. This time I am using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), which is a lot of fun. It has a lot of hooks you can play with.

The Twitter implosion seems to have made people curious about blogging and personal websites again. I miss the early days of the web when everyone was figuring things out. I can't imagine anyone launching a blog like [Dooce](https://web.archive.org/web/20050308022709/http://www.dooce.com/) these days. But people must still be writing blogs like that. Do they have a following? How do they find readers?  These questions feel just like when people ask "What did we do before Google."

I suppose I must have about half a dozen posts from each time I've done the Shiny New Platform project. That's what you're seeing here.

I'm going to look around and try to resurrect some old posts, some going back to around the year 2000.

It will be embarrassing.
