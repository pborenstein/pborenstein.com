The fun part of blogging is messing around with the blogging platform. Once you've done that, you have to fill it with something.
<!-- excerpt -->

I had a few articles about Git and Markdown, but I had this `pborenstein.dev` domain, because all the cool kids have a `.dev` domain. So I moved all that stuff [over there](https://pborenstein.dev), and now I need some 'content' to fill it with.

I've done this three or four times over the years, with a different blogging platform each time. This time it's with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), which is a lot of fun. It has a lot of hooks you can play with.

I've been messing around with Eleventy since around 2019. The Twitter implosion seems to have made people curious about blogging and personal websites again. I miss the early days of the web when everyone was figuring things out. I can't imagine anyone launching a blog like [Dooce](https://web.archive.org/web/20050308022709/http://www.dooce.com/) nowadays. People must still write like that. Do they have a following? How do they find readers?  The questions feel just when people ask "What did we do before Google."

I suppose I must have about half a dozen posts from each time I've done this project. I'll collect what I've done before. There should be some going back to around 2000. It will be embarrassing.
