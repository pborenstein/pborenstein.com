The fun part of blogging is messing around with the blogging platform. But once you've done that, you have to fill it with content.
<!-- excerpt -->

I had a few articles about Git and Markdown at this domain, but I also had the `pborenstein.dev` domain (because all the cool kids have a `.dev` domain), and I wanted to use it. So I moved all that stuff [over there](https://pborenstein.dev), and now I need some 'content' to fill it with.

Get ready to find out what I had for lunch.

I've tried ne blogging platforms three or four times over the years, with a different blogging platform each time. This time I am using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), which is a lot of fun. It has a lot of hooks you can play with. An [article about collections](https://pborenstein.dev/posts/collections/) seems to be the most popular.

The Twitter implosion seems to have made people curious about blogging and personal websites again. I miss the early days of the web when everyone was figuring things out. I can't imagine anyone launching a blog like [Dooce](https://web.archive.org/web/20050308022709/http://www.dooce.com/) these days. But people must still be writing blogs like that. Do they have a following? How do they find readers?  The questions feel just when people ask "What did we do before Google."

I suppose I must have about half a dozen posts from each time I've done the Shiny New Platform project. That's what you're seeing here.

I'm going to look around and try to resurrect some old posts, some going back to around the year 2000.

It will be embarrassing.
