The fun part of blogging is messing around with the blogging platform. Once you've done that, though, you have to fill it with something.

I had a few articles about Git and Markdown, but I had this `.dev` domain, so I moved all that stuff [over there](https://pborenstein.dev).

I've done this three or four times over the years, so I guess I must have about half a dozen posts from each time I've done this project. I'll look around and collect what I've done. There should be some going back to around 2000. 

The Twitter implosion and people learning about about Mastodon seem to have made people about blogging and personal websites.
