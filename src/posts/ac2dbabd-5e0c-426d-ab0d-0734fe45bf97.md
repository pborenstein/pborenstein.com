The fun part of blogging is messing around with the blogging platform. But once you've done that, you have to fill it with content.
<!-- excerpt -->

I had a few articles about Git and Markdown on this domain, but I also had the `pborenstein.dev` domain (because all the cool kids have a `.dev` domain), and I wanted to use it. So I moved all the technical stuff about Git, Markdown, and Eleventy, [over there](https://pborenstein.dev). An [article about collections](https://pborenstein.dev/posts/collections/) seems to be the most popular.


Now I need some content.

I've done the Re-Launch Your Blog with a Shiny New Platform project several times over the years. This time I am using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), which is a lot of fun. It has a lot of hooks you can play with.

For each time I did the Shiny New Platform project, there must be about half a dozen posts, some going back to the year 2000. That's what you'll be seeing here.

It will be embarrassing.
