<!-- excerpt -->
His most famous song, of course, is "Day-O". But for me it's "Mama Look at Boo Boo".

It was on a slightly warped LP hiding in my parents' collection, that I discovered at 12 years old. The line "I wonder why nobody don't like me, or is it the fact that I'm ugly?" really resonated with me at 12 :)
