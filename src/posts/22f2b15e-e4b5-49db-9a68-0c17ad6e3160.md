## Chapter 1

<!-- #### _The King's Party_ -->

<!-- excerpt -->
It was in the days of Achashvairosh -- this was the Achashvairosh who
reigned from India to Ethiopia, over a total of 127 provinces.
<!-- excerpt -->


In the third year of his reign the king had a party for all his ministers and
servants to display the wealth of his great empire. The party lasted 180 days.
After that, the king had another 7-day party in the garden of his palace
for everyone in Shushan. The drinks were served in gold goblets -- no two goblets were alike.
The drinks were served according to the law: no one was forced to drink,
because the king was all about consent.

<!-- #### _Vashti Refuses_ -->

Queen Vashti made a feast for the women in the royal house of King
Achashvairosh. On the seventh day, when the king was wicked drunk,
he ordered Vashti to come down wearing *only* her royal crown to
show the nations and the ministers her beauty, for she was wicked hot.

The Queen refused to come at the word of the king, and the king was seriously pissed off.

<!-- #### _The King's Reaction_ -->

The King spoke to his community leaders. The question was: what does the
law say should be done to Queen Vashti for
not obeying the command of King Achashvairosh?

<!-- #### _Memuchan's Advice_ -->

Memuchan, one of the advisors, said,


### _Memuchan_

> When Queen Vashti disobeyed, she hurt not only the king but also all the ministers of all the nations in all of the provinces of the empire.
> When word gets out, all women will treat their husbands with less respect, saying 'King Achashvairosh ordered Queen Vashti to come, and she didn't come, so I'm not listening to you.' <br/><br/>
> If it pleases the king, let him write an immutable law to the effect that Queen Vashti may never again come to King Achashvairosh, and that her royal position will be given to someone else more suitable.
> Let the decree be posted throughout the entire empire, even though it is very large, and then all the women will respect their husbands, regardless of their status.

The king and the ministers liked this idea, so they sent scrolls to all
the king's provinces, each scroll written in the
alphabet and language of the province, stating that a
man is legally the master of his own home, and that everyone in the household
must speak the man's native language.


## Chapter 2

<!-- #### _The Search For A New Queen_ -->

After these events, King Achashvairosh's anger abated. He remembered about Vashti and decided he needed a new queen.

### _SERVANT_

> Let's find a replacement for Vashti.
> Let the king appoint officials in each of the provinces of his empire to
> gather all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in Shushan, under
> the administration of the king's eunuch Hegai, guardian of the women, and give them cosmetics.
> And the woman that the king likes will rule instead of Vashti.

The King liked this idea, so he did it.

<!-- #### _Mordechai and Esther_ -->

There was a Jewish man in Shushan whose name was Mordechai, son of
Yair, son of so and so, son of so on and so forth. He had raised, Hadassah, his cousin, after she lost her parents. The Gentiles knew Hadassah as Esther because she had to have a cool handle. She was beautiful, with pleasant features, and
when her parents died Mordechai, who was her cousin or uncle, adopted her.

When he got word of the king's search for a new queen, he took Esther
to the palace, to Hadassah, guardian of the women.
Hadassah liked Esther, so he rushed to give her
cosmetics, food, seven maids from the palace,
and set her up in the best part of the harem.

Esther did not reveal her race or nationality, because Mordechai had
told her not to. Every day Mordechai would walk near the courtyard
of the harem to find out
how Esther was doing.

The line of women to the king progressed. Each woman
underwent the usual twelve-month treatment, which involved six
months' application of oil of myrrh and six months of perfumes and
cosmetics.
Each woman would arrive before the king in the evening,
and in the morning she would return to the second harem,
the one for concubines. No woman could return to the king
unless the king requested her by name.
Achashvairosh was not good with names.

In the tenth month (Tevet), in the seventh year of his reign
Esther was taken to King Achashvairosh.
The king loved Esther better than all the other women, and she pleased him more
than all the virgins. He set a royal crown on her head, and he made her
queen in place of Vashti.

The king made a big feast, called Esther's Feast, for all his ministers and servants. He declared a tax reduction for the provinces, and gave
royal gifts, which were paid for by reducing social services.

Also, Mordechai was
appointed to sit with the ministers at the King's Gate,

Esther still did not reveal her nationality or race, as Mordechai had
ordered her. Esther obeyed the words of Mordechai, her uncle or cousin, just as she did when he was
raising her.

<!-- #### _The Plot Against the King_ -->

One day, while sitting at the king's gate, Mordechai overheard two officers of the king's guards
conspiring to poison the king. Mordechai told Queen Esther.
Esther told the king,
citing Mordechai as her source.
The officers were hanged on gallows, and the matter was recorded
in the royal chronicle.


## Chapter 3

<!-- #### _Five years Later_ -->


After a while, King Achashvairosh promoted Haman to be his
prime minister. Haman had the king order his court and servants to 
kneel and bow to hime. But Mordechai would neither bow nor kneel.

### _SERVANT_

> Mordechai, my dude, why do you disobey the king? Why don't bow to Haman?

### _MORDECHAI_

> Because I am a Jew. I am forbidden to bow to Haman. I bow only to God.

Haman was really pissed that Mordechai wouldn't bow.
But when he found out that it was because Mordechai was Jewish,
he decided he was going to kill **_all_** the Jews in the empire.

(This is why he's called "Wicked Haman".)


<!-- #### _The Plot to Kill the Jews_ -->

Haman said to the king: 
### _HAMAN_

> There is a people scattered and separated among the nations throughout your empire. Their laws are different than everyone else's. They do not obey the king's laws, and it does not pay for the king to tolerate their existence.
> If it pleases the king, let a law be written that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand silver Kikar-coins for the king's treasury.

The king removed his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman.

### _KING_

> Keep the money, and do whatever you want with those people.

In the first month, Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Achashvairosh's
reign, Haman drew a _pur_, a lottery, to choose a day in the twelfth month,
Adar when the Jews would be eradicated..

On the thirteenth day of Nisan, Haman ordered the king's scribes to
write a decree: On the 13th of Adar,all of the Jews of the empire,
young and old, children and women, were to be killed and their property
pillaged.
This decree was
posted in throughout the empire.

The king and Haman sat down to drink, and the Jews
in the city of Shushan were unaware of what was coming.


## Chapter 4

<!-- #### _Mordechai Calls for Repentance_ -->

But Mordechai knew about Haman's decree. He tore his clothes and put
on sackcloth and ashes. He went to the center of the city and wailed loudly
and bitterly.

Esther's maids and attendants told her what Mordechai, her cousin or uncle, was doing and the queen became very
upset. She sent clothing to Mordechai, to replace his
sackcloth, but he would not accept them.
Esther asked one of her attendants find
out what was up with the sackcloth and ashes.

Mordechai gave the servant a copy of the decree that had been circulated in Shushan, with the words "to destroy them" highlighted. He told the servant to show the decree to Esther, and to command her to
go to the king to beg and plead for her people.


Esther responded to Mordechai:

### _ESTHER_

> Everyone knows that anyone who comes to the king in the inner court without being summoned is sentenced to death unless the king extends his royal scepter to them, granting them life. And the king has not called for me for thirty days now.

### _MORDECHAI_

> Don't imagine that you alone among the Jews will escape to the king's palace, and that this will save your life.

> Even if you are silent now, the Jews will get relief and rescue some other way, and you and your father's house will be lost. And who knows? Maybe it was for just such an occasion that you were made queen!

### _ESTHER_

> Gather all the Jews in Shushan. Tell them to fast for me: not to eat or drink for three days and nights. My girls and I will also fast. Then I'll go to the king -- which, as I mentioned, is against the law. If I die, I die.


## Chapter 5

<!-- #### _Esther Approaches the King_ -->

On the third day of the fast, Esther dressed in her royal clothes and
stood at the king's inner court, facing the king's apartment. The king was
sitting on his royal throne in the palace, facing the entrance.
When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased, and he
extended to Esther his golden scepter. Esther approached and
touched the tip of the scepter.

### _KING_

> What do you wish, Queen Esther? What is your request?
> I would give you up to half my empire.

### _ESTHER_

> If it please the king, could the king and Haman come later today to a little party I'm having?

### _KING_

> Heck yeah.

So the king and Haman
went to Esther's party.
Over drinks, the king said to Esther:

### _KING_

> Whatever your request, you will receive it. Whatever you desire, up to half my empire, it shall be done!

### _ESTHER_

> So, about my request and desire:
> If the king likes me, and if it pleases the king to grant me my request and desire, could the king and Haman come to another party tomorrow? Then I will reveal my true request and my true desire.


Haman was happy that he got invited not only to party with the queen, but also to party with her tomorrow.

But then he saw Mordechai at the king's gate,  and Mordechai refused to stand or even move at all for him. Haman got very
very pissed, but he controlled himself until he got home and let go on his wife.

### _HAMAN_

> I am the prime minister of the empire! The top man next to the king.
> In fact, Queen Esther invited no one else to the party she made for the king, except me! Plus she invited me to another party tomorrow, too!
> But this means nothing to me as long as that Jew Mordechai sits at the king's gate and refuses to bow to me.


Haman's wife knew what to do when her husband got like this.

### _HAMAN'S WIFE_

> You know what, Haman honey? Make a gallows 50 cubits high. In the morning go to the king and tell him to hang Mordechai on it. Then you can go to the party happy.


Haman liked the idea so much, that he didn't wait until tomorrow. He ran back to the palace right away.


## Chapter 6

<!-- #### _The Wheel Turns_ -->

Meanwhile, the king was having trouble sleeping, so he asked his attendants to bring the book of
chronicles, and to read to him. This always put Achashvairosh to sleep.

When they got to the entry about Mordechai thwarting the plot to kill the king, Achashvairosh, sat up.

### _KING_

> What reward was given to Mordechai for this?

### _SERVANT_

> Lemme look. Uhm, nothing.

### _KING_

> What's the sound in the courtyard.

### _SERVANT_

> Looks like Haman. Wonder what he's doing here?

Haman was so excited about his wife's plan that he wanted to tell the king
about hanging Mordechai on the that 50-cubit gallows right away.

### _KING_

> Tell Haman to come in!

So the servants brought Haman to see the king.

### _KING_

> Listen Haman. There's this guy who did something amazing for me, and I want to honor him. How do you think I should do that?


### _HAMAN_

> (to himself)  Oh boy! He must be talking about me!<br/><br/>
> Well, King, if you really want to honor someone, here's what you do.
> Have one of your most trusted ministers put one of your royal robes on 
> the man you wish to honor. Put the man on your royal horse. Then have the
> minister lead the man on the horse through town crying:
> THIS! THIS IS WHAT THE KING DOES FOR SOMEONE HE WISHES TO HONOR!


### _KING_

> What a great idea, Haman. Here, take this robe and my horse to Mordechai the Jew, and do just as you said. Lead Mordechai on my horse through the streets of Shushan. Don't leave out a single thing.


Haman took the clothes and horse. He dressed Mordechai and led him
through the streets of Shushan as he called out

### _HAMAN_

> THIS! THIS IS WHAT THE KING DOES FOR SOMEONE HE WISHES TO HONOR!

After this little romp, Mordechai returned to the king's gate, but Haman hurried home, depressed, and with his head covered.


## Chapter 7

<!-- #### _Esther's Plea_ -->

But soon it was time for Esther's second pary,  and the king and Haman came to hang out.

The king was in a good mood.

### _KING_

> Whatever your desire, Queen Esther, you shall have. And whatever you request, up to half the kingdom, will be done.

### _ESTHER_

> If the king likes me, and if it please the king: grant me my life as my desire, and my people as my request.
> My people and I have been sold to be destroyed, killed, and eradicated. Had we been only sold as slaves I wouldn't have bothered you.

<!-- #### _The Plot Is Overthrown_ -->

### _KING_

> WHAT? What is this? Who would dare do this?"

### _ESTHER_

> That man, the persecutor, the enemy, is that evil Haman there!


In his anger, Achashvairosh stood up and stormed out to the garden to think.
While the king was out in the garden, Haman threw himself on Esther, who was lying on her couch. He was pleading for his life, but the king didn't see it that way when he came back.

### _KING_

> DUDE! WTF? You're making moves on Queen Esther when I'm standing right outside? <BR/>
> GUARDS! Take him away

### _SERVANT_

> You know, king, there's a gallows 50 cubits high that Haman made for Mordechai. Just sayin'

### _KING_

> Hang him on it.

So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordechai.
The king's anger subsided.

## Chapter 8

<!-- #### _The Circle is Complete_ -->

On the day Haman was executed, King Achashvairosh gave Queen Esther Haman's house. With Haman out of the way, Mordechai revealed his relationship as Esther's uncle. Or cousin. Or whatever.

The king took the ring he had given Haman to seal the Jews' death warrant, and gave it to Mordechai, whom Esther put in charge of running Haman's house.

<!-- #### _Esther Pleads for Full Mercy_ -->

Once again, Esther spoke to the king, falling at his feet. She cried and
pleaded with him to overturn Haman's evil decree
to kill the Jews.

The king extended his golden scepter to Esther, and she stood up before the
king.

### _ESTHER_

> If it pleases the king, and if the king likes me, and if he thinks this is a good idea, and if he approves of me, let a decree be written to repeal the Haman's decree, which was to kill the Jews throughout the empire.


<!-- #### _A New Decree Is Issued_ -->

### _KING_

> No can do, toots. The original decree was signed with the royal signet ring, so it cannot be repealed. What to do, what to do?
> I know! Mordechai! You write up a new decree to fix this, then sign it with the royal signet ring, so it can't be repealed.

Mordechai's new decree stated that
for one day, on the 13th day of Adar,
the king would allow the Jews of
each city in the empire to gather and to defend themselves against Haman's execution order.


Copies of the new decree were distributed in each province, so that
the Jews would be ready to take revenge against their enemies on that day.

<!-- #### _The Triumphal Celebration_ -->

Mordechai left the king's presence wearing royal clothing of blue and
white, with a large golden crown, and a robe of fine purple linen; then the
city of Shushan was lighthearted and joyful.

The Jews were now able to enjoy the light of Torah, the delight of the
Jewish Holidays, and the joy of the commandments.

## Chapter 9

<!-- #### _The Day of the Battle_ -->


The 13th day of the 12th month, which is the month of Adar, the enemies
of the Jews had hoped
to overpower the Jews, but the plot was thwarted, and the Jews
overpowered their enemies.
Throughout King Achashvairosh's provinces the Jews gathered in their cities
to defend themselves against those who tried to hurt them. No one could
withstand them, because everyone was afraid of them.
The Jews struck at all their opponents with the sword, killing and
destroying them, and they defeated all their enemies.


### _KING_

> Esther, in Shushan the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men, as well as the ten sons of Haman. Who knows what they did in the more distant provinces of the empire? Whatever you want, you will be given; whatever your request, it will be done.

### _ESTHER_

> If it pleases the king, may the Jews of Shushan have tomorrow also, with the same rules as today?

So the Jews of Shushan gathered again on the fourteenth day of Adar, and
they killed another three hundred men in Shushan, but they did not pillage
their property.
The Jews in the rest of the empire also gathered to defend themselves and
demand peace from their enemies. They killed a total of seventy-five
thousand, but they did not pillage their property.

They fought their battle on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and
they made the fourteenth day of Adar a day
of feasting and celebration.
That's why the Jews observe the fourteenth day of Adar as
a day of feasting and rejoicing  and of sending
gifts of food to friends and to the poor.
These days must be remembered and observed for every generation, in every
family, in every part of the world, in every city. The Holiday of Purim will
never be abolished among the Jews, and their descendants will never cease to
observe it.
