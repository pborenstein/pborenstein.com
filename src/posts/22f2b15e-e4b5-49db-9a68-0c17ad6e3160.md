## Chapter 1

<!-- #### _The King's Party_ -->

It was in the days of Achashvairosh -- this was the Achashvairosh who
reigned from India to Ethiopia, over a total of 127 provinces.

In the third year of his reign the king had a party for all his ministers and
servants to display the wealth of his great empire. The party lasted 180 days.
After that, the king had another 7-day party in the garden of his palace
for everyone in Shushan. The drinks were served in gold goblets -- no two goblets were alike.
The drinks were served according to the law: no one was forced to drink,
because the king was all about consent.

<!-- #### _Vashti Refuses_ -->

Queen Vashti made a feast for the women in the royal house of King
Achashvairosh. On the seventh day, when the king was wicked drunk,
he ordered Vashti to come down wearing *only* her royal crown to
show the nations and the ministers her beauty, for she was wicked hot.

The Queen refused to come at the word of the king, and the king was seriously pissed off.

<!-- #### _The King's Reaction_ -->

The King spoke to his community leaders. The question was: what does the
law say should be done to Queen Vashti for
not obeying the command of King Achashvairosh?

<!-- #### _Memuchan's Advice_ -->

Memuchan, one of the advisors, said,


### _SERVANT_

> When Queen Vashti was
disobedient, she hurt not only the king but also all the ministers of all the
nations in all of the provinces of King Achashvairosh's empire.
> When word gets out, all women will
treat their husbands with less respect, saying
'King Achashvairosh ordered Queen Vashti to come, and she didn't come.' <br/><br/>
> If it pleases the king, let him write an immutable
law to the effect that Queen
Vashti may never again come to King Achashvairosh, and that her royal position
will be given to someone else more suitable.
> Let the King's decree be posted throughout the entire empire, even though
it is very large, and then all the women will respect their husbands,
regardless of their status.

The king and the ministers liked this idea, so they sent scrolls to all
the king's provinces, each scroll written in the
alphabet and language of the province, stating that the
man is legally the master of his own home, and that everyone in the household
must speak the man's native language.


## Chapter 2

<!-- #### _The Search For A New Queen_ -->

After these events, King Achashvairosh's anger abated, and he remembered
Vashti and what had happened to her.

### _SERVANT_

> Let's find a replacement for Vashti.
Let king should appoint officials in each of the provinces of his empire to
gather all the beautiful young virgins at the harem in Shushan, under
the administration of the king's eunuch Hegai, guardian of the women, and give
them cosmetics.
> And the woman that the king likes can rule instead of Vashti.

The King liked this idea, so he did it.

<!-- #### _Mordechai and Esther_ -->

There was a Jewish man in Shushan whose name was Mordechai, son of
Yair, son of so on and so forth. He had raised his cousin Hadassah after she lost her parents. The Gentiles
knew her as Esther. She was a beautiful woman, with pleasant features, and
when her parents died Mordechai adopted her.

When word of the king's decree became known, Esther was taken
to the palace, to Hegai, guardian of the women.
He liked the young woman, and he approved of her, so he rushed to give her
cosmetics, food, and seven maids from the palace,
and set her up in the best part of the harem.

Esther did not reveal her race or nationality, because Mordechai had
ordered her not to. Every day Mordechai would walk near the courtyard
of the harem to find out
how Esther was doing and what was happening with her.

The line of women to the king progressed, as each woman
underwent the usual twelve-month treatment, which involved six
months' application of oil of myrrh and six months of perfumes and feminine
cosmetics.
Each woman would arrive before the king in the evening,
and in the morning she would return to the second harem,
the one for concubines. She would not return to the king
unless the king wanted her and requested her by name.

Esther was taken to King Achashvairosh the tenth month,
Tevet, in the seventh year of his reign.
The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she pleased him more
than all the virgins, so he set a royal crown on her head, and he made her
queen instead of Vashti.

The king made a big feast for all his ministers and servants, called
Esther's Feast, and he declared a tax reduction for the provinces, and gave
royal gifts.

At that time, Mordechai was
appointed to sit with the ministers at the King's Gate,

And Esther still did not reveal her nationality or race, as Mordechai had
ordered her. Esther obeyed the words of Mordechai just as she did when he was
raising her.

<!-- #### _The Plot Against the King_ -->

Once, while Mordechai was sitting at the king's gate,
two officers of the king's night guards
conspired to poison the king. Mordechai found out about it,
so he told Queen Esther, and Esther told the king,
citing Mordechai as her source.
Both officers were hanged on gallows, and the matter was recorded
in the royal chronicle.


## Chapter 3

<!-- #### _Five years Later_ -->


After those events, King Achashvairosh promoted Haman to be his
prime minister. All the king's servants in the king's court would
kneel and bow in religious
worship to Haman, because the king had commanded it, but Mordechai would
neither bow nor kneel.

### _SERVANT_

> Mordechai, why do you disobey the king? How come you don't bow to Haman?

### _MORDECHAI_

> Because I am a Jew. I am forbidden to bow to Haman.

Haman was really pissed that Mordechai wouldn't bow to him.
But when he found out that it was because Mordechai was Jewish,
he decided he was going to kill **_all_** the Jews in the empire.

(This is why he's called "Wicked Haman".)

In the first month, Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Achashvairosh's
reign, Haman drew a _pur_, a lottery, which chose a day in the twelfth month,
Adar.

<!-- #### _The Plot to Kill the Jews_ -->

### _HAMAN_

> There is a people scattered and separated
among the nations throughout your empire.
Their laws are different than
everyone else's.
They do not obey the king's laws, and it does not pay for the
king to tolerate their existence.
> If it pleases the king, let a law be written that they be destroyed, and I
will pay to the executors ten thousand silver Kikar-coins for the king's
treasury.

The king removed his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman.

### _KING_

> Keep the money, and do whatever you want with those people.

On the thirteenth day of the first month, Haman had the king's scribes
write a decree that, on the 13th of Adar, all the Jews of the empire,
young and old, children and women, were to be killed and their property
pillaged.
The public decree was
posted in throughout the empire. The king and Haman sat down to drink, and the Jews
in the city of Shushan were unaware of what it meant.


## Chapter 4

<!-- #### _Mordechai Calls for Repentance_ -->

But Mordechai knew of all that had happened, and he tore his clothes and put
on sackcloth and ashes. He went to the center of the city and wailed a loud
and bitter cry.

Esther's maids and attendants came and told her, and the queen became very
upset. She sent clothing to Mordechai, to replace his
sackcloth, but he would not accept them.
Esther told one of her attendants to tak to Mordechai and find
out what was up with the sackcloth and ashes.

Mordechai gave the servant a copy of the decree that had been circulated in Shushan, which
contained the words "to destroy them," to show Esther, and to command her to
go to the king to beg and plead to him for her people.


Esther responded to Mordechai:

### _ESTHER_

>Everyone knows that any
man or woman who comes to the king in the inner court without being summoned
is sentenced to death by the law, unless the king extends his royal scepter to
them, granting them life. And the king has not called for me for thirty days
now."

### _MORDECHAI_

>Don't imagine that you alone among the
Jews will escape to the king's palace, and that this will save your life.
>Even if you are silent now, the Jews will get relief and rescue some other
way, and you and your father's house will be lost. And who knows? Maybe it was
for just such an occasion that you were made queen!"

### _ESTHER_

> Go and gather all the Jews in Shushan, fast for me: do not eat or drink
for three days and nights. My girls and I will also fast. Then I'll go to the
king -- against the law -- and if I die, I die."


## Chapter 5

<!-- #### _Esther Approaches the King_ -->

On the third day of the fast, Esther dressed in her royal clothes and
stood at the king's inner court, facing the king's apartment. The king was
sitting on his royal throne in the palace, facing the entrance.
When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased, and he
extended to Esther the golden scepter he was holding. Esther approached and
touched the tip of the scepter.

### _KING_

> What do you wish, Queen Esther? What is your request?
I would give you up to half the empire."

### _ESTHER_

>If it please the king, could the king and Haman come today to
a little party I'm having?

### _KING_

> Heck yeah.

So the king and Haman
went to Esther's party.
Over drinks, the king said to Esther:

### _KING_

> Whatever your request,
you will receive it. Whatever you desire, up until half the empire, it shall
be done!

### _ESTHER_

> So, about my request and desire:
> If the king likes me, and if it pleases the king to grant me my request and
desire, could the king and Haman come to another party for them
tomorrow?
Tomorrow I will reveal my
request and my desire.


Haman was wicked happy and feeling good, but when  he saw Mordechai at
the king's gate refuse to even stand or move at all for him, Haman got very
very pissed. Haman controlled himself until he got home.

### _HAMAN_

> I am the prime minister of the empire. The top man next to the king.
In fact, Queen Esther invited no one else to the banquet she
made for the king, except me! Plus she invited me to another party tomorrow, too!
> But none of this means anything to me as long as I see that Jew Mordechai
sitting at the king's gate.

### _HAMAN'S WIFE_

> You know what? Make a gallows 50 cubits high. In the morning go to
the king and tell him to hang Mordechai on it. Then you can go to
the party happy.


Haman liked the idea so much, that he ran back to the palace right away.


## Chapter 6

<!-- #### _The Wheel Turns_ -->

That night the king couldn't sleep, so he told his attendants to bring the book of
chronicles, and to read to him. They found an entry in the
book describing how Mordechai thwarted the plot
against the  king.

### _KING_

> What reward was given to Mordechai for this?

### _SERVANT_

> Lemme look. Uhm, nothing.

### _KING_

> What's the sound in the courtyard.

### _SERVANT_

> Looks like Haman. Wonder what he's doing here?

Haman was so excited about his wife's plan that he wanted to tell him
about hanging Mordechai on the that 50-cubit gallows.

### _KING_

> Tell Haman to come in!

So the servants brought Haman to see the king.

### _KING_

> Listen Haman. There's this guy I want to honor. How do you think I should do that?


### _HAMAN_

> (to himself)  Oh boy! He must be talking about me!<br/><br/>
> Well, King, if you really want to honor someone, here's what you do.
> Have one of your most trusted ministers put one of your royal robes on 
> the man you want to honor. Put the man on your royal horse. Then have the
> minister lead the man on the horse through town crying:
> THIS! THIS IS WHAT THE KING DOES FOR SOMEONE HE WISHES TO HONOR!


### _KING_

> What a great idea. Here, take this robe and my horse to the Jew Mordechai,
and do just as you said. Lead Mordechai on my horse through the streets of
Shushan. Don't leave out a thing.


Haman took the clothes and horse, he dressed Mordechai, and he led him
through the streets of the city, and he called out

### _HAMAN_

> THIS! THIS IS WHAT THE KING DOES FOR SOMEONE HE WISHES TO HONOR!

Mordechai returned to the king's gate, but Haman hurried home, depressed,
and with his head covered.


## Chapter 7

<!-- #### _Esther's Plea_ -->

Later that day,  king and Haman came to drink with Queen Esther at her second party.

### _KING_

> Whatever
your desire, Queen Esther, you shall have. And whatever you request, up until
half the empire, will be done.

### _ESTHER_

> If the king likes me, and if it please the king,
grant me my life as my desire, and my people as my request.
> My people and I have been sold to be destroyed, killed, and eradicated. Had
we been sold as slaves I wouldn't have bothered you.

<!-- #### _The Plot Is Overthrown_ -->

### _KING_

> WHAT? Who is this? Who would dare do this?"

### _ESTHER_

> That man, the persecutor, the enemy, is that evil Haman there!


In his anger, the king stood up and went to the palace garden.
Haman fell upon Esther on her couch, pleading for his life.

### _KING_

> DUDE! WTF? You're making moves on Esther when I'm right outside? <BR/>
> GUARDS! Take him away

### _SERVANT_

> You know, there's a gallows 50 cubits high in Haman's house that Haman made
for Mordechai. Just sayin'

### _KING_

> Hang him on it.

So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordechai, and the
king's anger subsided.

## Chapter 8

<!-- #### _The Circle is Complete_ -->

That day, King Achashvairosh gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the
persecutor of the Jews. Mordechai came before the king, because Esther had
revealed their relationship.

The king removed the ring he had given Haman and gave it to Mordechai, and
Esther put Mordechai in charge of Haman's house.

<!-- #### _Esther Pleads for Full Mercy_ -->

Once again, Esther spoke to the king, falling at his feet. She cried and
pleaded with him to overturn the evil of Haman the Agagite and his plan
against the Jews.

The king extended his golden scepter to Esther, and she stood up before the
king.

### _ESTHER_

> If it pleases the king, and if the king likes me, and if he
thinks this is a good idea, and if he approves of me, let a decree be written
to repeal the decree of the Haman's plot, which
was to kill the Jews throughout the empire.


<!-- #### _A New Decree Is Issued_ -->

### _KING_

> Since the original decree was signed with the royal signet ring,
it cannot be repealed. What to do, what to do?
> I know! Mordechai, write up a new decree concerning the Jews as you see fit,
and sign it with the royal signet ring.

The decree that Mordechai wrote stated that,
for one day, on the 13th day of Adar,
the king permits the Jews of
each city in the empire to gather and defend themselves,


Copies of the letter were to be publicly distributed in each province, that
the Jews were to be ready on that day to take revenge against their enemies.

<!-- #### _The Triumphal Celebration_ -->

Mordechai left the king's presence wearing royal clothing of blue and
white, with a large golden crown, and a robe of fine, purple linen; then the
city of Shushan was lighthearted and joyful.

The Jews were now able to enjoy the light of Torah, the delight of the
Jewish Holidays, the joy of the commandments.

## Chapter 9

<!-- #### _The Day of the Battle_ -->


The 13th day of the 12th month, which is the month of Adar, the enemies
of the Jews had hoped
to overpower the Jews that day, but the plot was overturned, and the Jews
overpowered their enemies.
Throughout King Achashvairosh's provinces the Jews gathered in their cities
to defend themselves against those who tried to hurt them. No one could
withstand them, because everyone was afraid of them.
The Jews struck at all their opponents with the sword, killing and
destroying them, and they defeated all their enemies.


### _KING_

> Esther, in Shushan the Jews killed and
destroyed five hundred men, as well as the ten sons of Haman. Who knows what
they did in the more distant provinces of the empire? Whatever you want, you
will be given; whatever your request, it will be done.

### _ESTHER_

> If it pleases the king, may the Jews of Shushan have
tomorrow also, with the same rules as today?

So the Jews of Shushan gathered again on the fourteenth day of Adar, and
they killed another three hundred men in Shushan, but they did not pillage
their property.
The Jews in the rest of the empire also gathered to defend themselves and
get peace from their enemies, and they killed a total of seventy-five
thousand, but they did not pillage their property.

They fought their battle on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and
they made the fourteenth day of Adar a day
of feasting and celebration.
That's why the Jews observe the fourteenth day of Adar as
as days of feasting and rejoicing, the sending of
portions of food to friends, and gifts to poor people.
These days must be remembered and observed for every generation, every
family, in every part of the world, in every city. The Holiday of Purim will
never be abolished among the Jews, and their descendants will never cease to
observe them.
